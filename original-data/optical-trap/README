Vijay,

  I've attached a copy of the submitted version of the paper. I've noted a few typos in the numerical listing of the data in the Supplemental info.

  I've also attached a segment of a long trajectory of the hairpin in the paper with a 30 bp long stem (called in the paper hairpin 30R50/T4). This is the extension of the molecule, recorded at 25 kHz (time interval of 40 us). Sorry, it's 
still a really big file, despite truncating it!

  My schedule for the rest of the week, for another meeting: I'm tied up until noon on Thursday, otherwise free. I'm also free on Monday (Saturday afternoon, too, if you're around!).
