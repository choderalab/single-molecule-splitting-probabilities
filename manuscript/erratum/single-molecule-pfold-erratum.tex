% ERRATUM
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our recent paper on a reaction coordinate test for single-molecule experiments based on computation of the splitting probability~\cite{chodera-pande:prl:2011:splitting} contained two typographical errors.
Eq.~1 (describing overdamped Langevin dynamics) contained a significant typographical error in the first term of the right-hand side, and should have read
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{x}(t) &=& - \frac{1}{\gamma(x)} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}F(x) + \sqrt{2 D(x)} R(t) \nonumber,
\end{eqnarray}
where the function $\gamma(x)$ is related to $D(x)$ through the fluctuation-dissipation relation.
Eq.~5 (describing auxiliary functions used in computing the hitting function) omitted primes in $x(t)$, and should have read
\begin{eqnarray}
\tau_A(t) &=& \inf \{ t' > t : x(t') < a \} \nonumber \\
\tau_B(t) &=& \inf \{ t' > t : x(t') > b \} \nonumber .
\end{eqnarray}
Neither typographical error affects the remaining equations or results in the paper, and the correct forms of these equations were used in the computations performed therein.

We thank Alexander Grosberg (NYU) for pointing out the first error.
